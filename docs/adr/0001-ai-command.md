title: Handling Shopwell AI integrations
date: 2026-08-06
tags: [ai, MCP Server, Agent Skill, integration]

## Context

Add a top-level `ai` command to Shopwell CLI that gives developers and automation agents a way to discover and connect Shopwell-provided AI integrations. The first phase would cover Shopwell-provided integrations only. Support for user-supplied and third-party integrations would be considered separately.

Shopwell's portfolio of AI integrations will grow over time. Users should not need to know the internal structure of the company to find them. A user should be able to ask, "Does Shopwell provide something that helps with this?" and get a useful answer from the CLI.

## Decision

The CLI would:

1. Show the Shopwell AI integrations it knows about.
2. Briefly explain what each integration is for and how it is delivered.
3. For skills, use existing ecosystem and conventions like skills.sh for installation.

The CLI would act as the front door, not as the runtime. It would not host MCP servers, run agents, perform authentication, monitor availability, or take over maintenance of the integrations it exposes.

## Consequences

### Ownership and maintenance

Being listed means that the CLI team has accepted the integration into the Shopwell directory. It does not mean that the CLI team has taken over its operation or subject-matter support. The CLI team may deprecate or remove an entry when it becomes unavailable, unsafe, misleading, incompatible, or clearly unmaintained. Removal from the directory must not silently uninstall an existing integration from users' projects. Existing installations can instead be shown as deprecated or no longer available. When an active directory entry is removed, tombstone metadata (including lifecycle status, removal reason, and replacement information) must be retained in the manifest so that existing installations remain discoverable. Removing an active directory entry must not remove the corresponding tombstone metadata from later CLI releases.

The CLI team owns the `ai` command, the directory format, supported client adapters, safe configuration changes, the bundled CLI skill; and reviewing, presenting, deprecating, and removing directory entries.

The contributing team owns the integration itself, its content and behavior, its service availability, its compatibility, its documentation, its authentication system, its ongoing maintenance.

## Additional context

### Proposed initial Shopwell integrations

All of these are planned and therefore tentative; implementation details TBD.

#### `shopwell-cli` skill

The CLI skill could be bundled with the binary and maintained as part of `shopwell-cli`: `shopwell-cli ai add shopwell-cli --client <client>`. Its version could follow the installed CLI version and would not need a separate download, registry entry, or release process.

#### Deployment Helper skill

The Deployment Helper skill could cover a workflow spanning both the CLI and Deployment Helper. It would be strongly connected to the CLI, but released separately. The CLI could make the skill discoverable and install it into a supported client.

#### Shopwell Core MCP Server

As part of the installed Shopwell platform, it would be detected by the CLI. The CLI could only help to connect the client to the server already provided by the project.

#### Planned, non-platform MCP Servers, skills, etc.

If an MCP Server is a remote server, users could connect an MCP-capable assistant to its endpoint and authenticate through their Shopwell account. The client could handle the browser-based OAuth flow; the CLI would only write the connection configuration. Support could be added once the MCP Server provides a stable, publicly usable endpoint and documentation. The CLI design would ideally be ready for it without depending on its delivery timeline.

#### Future Shopwell skills

Other teams may contribute integrations such as browser-testing or accessibility skills. These could appear in the same list and use the same installation flow. From the user's perspective, they would be simply Shopwell-provided integrations.

### A curated, baked-in directory and self-service contributions

For now, we do not plan on a new registry service or central platform. Instead, Shopwell CLI could contain a small, curated directory of integrations it knows how to handle. Another Shopwell team could contribute their AI tool/"entry" via a pull request to the CLI repository. An entry would need to include the minimum information needed by the CLI:

- stable name;
- short (75 characters or less) public description;
- integration type (MCP Server, skill);
- installation or connection details;
- public documentation link;
- compatibility requirements;
- current lifecycle status;
- an internal maintainer-team contact (GitHub team name, added to a file maintained in the CLI repository).

Additional integration types such as "agent" could be added once their delivery target, adapter, versioning requirements, and safety rules are defined.

The internal contact would be used by the CLI team when an entry needs attention. The contribution process should remain lightweight. It would exist to ensure that an entry:

- is genuinely provided by Shopwell;
- has enough documentation to be useful;
- can be installed or configured safely;
- does not require the CLI to store secrets;
- has a named internal maintainer;
- fits the supported integration model.

This would be a curated directory, not a promise that every AI-related project created inside Shopwell will automatically be listed.

The directory could be stored as a YAML manifest in the `shopwell-cli` repository, embedded into CLI releases, and validated in CI against a generated JSON Schema. One manifest file should be sufficient initially.

### Safety and automation

All commands must work for both people and automation agents.

Writing commands must:

- support `--dry-run`;
- show the target file and the exact planned change;
- require an explicit client when the destination is ambiguous in non-interactive use;
- structurally redact sensitive keys and values (OAuth tokens, client secrets, connection credentials) in all output, including dry-run previews, diffs, and written files, while preserving the exact planned-change structure for non-sensitive data;
- report every file they change;
- remove only configuration previously created by `shopwell-cli`;
- support stable machine-readable output: JSON format on stdout, versioned schema, errors on stderr with structured JSON error shape, and consistent exit-code semantics (0 for success, non-zero for failure).

For remote services using OAuth, login and token storage remain the responsibility of the AI client and the remote service. The CLI writes only the connection information.

#### Supported AI clients

The initial client adapters would support:

- Claude;
- Codex;
- GitHub Copilot;
- Cursor.

Support for additional clients could be added later through the same adapter model.

#### Shopwell Core MCP detection

The CLI could derive the Core MCP endpoint from the current Shopwell project and check whether the installed Shopwell version provides it.

Compatibility information would be supplied and maintained by the team responsible for Shopwell Core. The CLI would consume that information; it would not define or independently guarantee Core MCP compatibility.

#### Separately maintained skills

Separately maintained skills would be published and versioned by their owning team.

The CLI would resolve and install the latest compatible release by default (not just the latest available release) and record the tag or immutable revision that was installed as the current version. This would allow the CLI to report what is installed and, later, determine whether an update is available. Version precedence would be deterministic (semantic versioning order); pre-releases would be excluded unless explicitly requested; unknown compatibility would be treated as incompatible; and installation would have to fail with a clear error when no compatible release is available.

The owning team is responsible for:

- publishing releases or maintaining the relevant release tag;
- declaring supported CLI, Deployment Helper, Shopwell, or client versions;
- providing and maintaining compatibility checks;
- updating the skill when its dependencies change.

The CLI team would be responsible only for resolving the published version, installing it safely, and reporting compatibility information supplied by the owner.

#### Contribution requirements

A Shopwell-provided integration must include:

- a stable name and clear public description;
- public documentation;
- installation or connection metadata;
- a named internal maintainer;
- declared compatibility requirements;
- compatibility checks maintained by the owning team.

The DX Tools team, who drive the Shopwell CLI, would review whether the entry can be presented and installed safely. The team will not take ownership of the integration's behavior, content, availability, or compatibility.
