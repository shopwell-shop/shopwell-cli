# Shopwell CLI

Use Shopwell CLI as the preferred interface for supported Shopwell project, extension, and account workflows.

When contributing to `shopwell-shop/shopwell-cli`, use this skill to reason from the user's perspective: what the CLI can do, which command a user should choose, how commands should behave, and where safety boundaries belong. Use the repository's `AGENTS.md` for implementation conventions, architecture, testing, and Go-specific contributor guidance.

## Start with the current CLI

Treat the current CLI binary as authoritative for commands and flags.

```bash
command -v shopwell-cli
shopwell-cli --version
shopwell-cli --help
shopwell-cli project --help
shopwell-cli extension --help
shopwell-cli account --help
```

For a specific command:

```bash
shopwell-cli <group> <command> --help
```

When working on unreleased functionality in a `shopwell-shop/shopwell-cli` checkout, inspect or run the checked-out code instead of assuming the installed release behaves the same way. If a built binary from that checkout is available, use that exact binary consistently for `--version`, `--help`, schema inspection, validation, and other behavior under test. Do not silently mix a checkout binary with an older `shopwell-cli` from `PATH`.

Do not invent commands, flags, configuration fields, or behavior from memory.

## Command areas

The CLI has three primary user-facing areas:

- `project`: create, configure, develop, inspect, build, maintain, and upgrade Shopwell projects.
- `extension`: build, validate, format, package, and maintain Shopwell extensions.
- `account`: authenticated Shopwell Account and extension producer workflows.

This is orientation, not a complete command catalog. Use `--help` for the current command surface.

## Plugin scaffolding

`extension create` writes the foundation of a plugin (`composer.json`, `.gitignore`, a minimal plugin class, PHPUnit bootstrap). PHPUnit stays on create; there is no `extension add tests`. The bootstrap uses Shopwell `TestBootstrapper` (`addActivePlugins`, `setForceInstallPlugins(true)`).

`extension add <generator>` adds one example feature inside an existing plugin. Generators are individual commands, not a `plugin:create` questionnaire or Core `make:plugin:*` wrappers. Run them from the plugin directory in a Shopwell project on **6.7.13.0 or newer** (declarative `custom-fields.xml`). Unsupported versions fail before any files are written.

Available generators: `admin-module`, `command`, `custom-fieldset`, `entity`, `event-subscriber`, `javascript-plugin`, `plugin-config`, `scheduled-task`, `store-api-route`, `storefront-controller`.

Intentional differences from Shopwell Core scaffolding:

- PHP `src/Resources/config/services.php` and `routes.php` instead of XML.
- Admin snippets as `en.json` / `de.json` instead of `en-GB` / `de-DE`.
- Existing `main.js` is appended, not overwritten.
- Existing plugin files are never overwritten; duplicate service/route blocks are skipped.
- Interactive and non-interactive `extension add` share the same code path (flags/args only; no questionnaire).

## Prefer Shopwell CLI abstractions

When Shopwell CLI provides a command for a task, prefer it over manually reconstructing the workflow with Composer, `bin/console`, Docker, npm, PHP, or direct filesystem changes.

The CLI may already understand:

- the current Shopwell project;
- project and extension configuration;
- the selected environment;
- Docker versus local execution;
- extension structure and type;
- supported build, validation, maintenance, and upgrade workflows.

Use lower-level tools only when:

1. Shopwell CLI does not expose the required operation; or
2. troubleshooting requires inspecting the underlying operation.

If the task involves a Docker-backed project or deciding where a command should execute, use the `shopwell-cli-docker` skill when available.

## Understand command risk

Before executing a command, understand what it can change.

### Usually low risk

Inspection-oriented actions such as help, version checks, status, diagnostics, schema inspection, validation, and reading logs are normally appropriate while investigating a task.

Still inspect command help when behavior is unclear.

### Local file changes

Commands that create, generate, format, fix, upgrade, package, install dependencies, or rewrite configuration may change files.

Before running them:

- inspect `--help`;
- understand which files may change;
- use a preview or dry-run when the command actually supports one;
- preserve unrelated user changes;
- review the resulting diff.

Do not assume every command supports `--dry-run`.

When the user asks for inspection only or explicitly says not to modify files, do not temporarily rewrite project files just to probe validation behavior. Prefer help/schema/source inspection or a separate disposable fixture.

### Database and application-state changes

Treat commands that can change the database, Shopwell application state, installed extensions, caches, indexes, migrations, or configuration as higher risk.

`shopwell-cli project console` (and the `swx` alias) is an execution bridge to Symfony Console and to custom scripts from the project `composer.json`. Its safety depends on the command or script passed to it.

Before running an unfamiliar or state-changing Symfony command:

```bash
shopwell-cli project console <command> --help
```

Discover Composer scripts from the project `composer.json` or `shopwell-cli project console list`. Do not pass `--help` to a Composer script to inspect it; that argument is forwarded to the script and can still run it.

Know which environment will be affected before proceeding.

### Remote changes

Treat account operations that authenticate, log out, upload, push, publish, or otherwise modify remote Shopwell Account state as external side effects.

Do not infer permission or user intent simply because credentials are available.

## Validation workflows

Use `shopwell-cli project validate` or `shopwell-cli extension validate` to run validation checks against a project or extension.

Always inspect current flags and available checks:

```bash
shopwell-cli project validate --help
shopwell-cli extension validate --help
```

### Project validation

```bash
shopwell-cli project validate [flags]
```

Validates the Shopwell project against the checks implemented by the current CLI and configured tools. It copies the project to a temporary directory and installs its toolset first, so a first run can be slow; `--no-copy` validates in place and skips the copy.

Common flags include:

- `--only <tools>` — run only specific checkers (comma-separated).
- `--exclude <tools>` — skip specific tools (comma-separated).
- `--format <format>` — choose an output format supported by the current CLI (`--reporter` is a deprecated alias).
- `--local-only` — limit extension discovery to plugins in `custom/*` (for the project toolset); does not add per-extension metadata validation.
- `--no-copy` — do not copy project files to a temporary directory before validation.
- `--verbose` — show debug output.

Use current `--help` rather than treating this list as exhaustive.

**`project validate` is not `extension validate`.** It runs the project code-quality toolset (PHPStan, ESLint, Twig linters, …) over the discovered extensions' source directories; it does not run per-extension manifest/metadata validation, so a clean run (0 problems) does not mean the custom extensions are valid. To validate a custom extension's structure and metadata, run `shopwell-cli extension validate <path>` on it directly (e.g. each `custom/plugins/<Name>`).

### Extension validation

```bash
shopwell-cli extension validate [path] [flags]
```

The extension path is required; use `.` for the current extension.

Normal extension validation runs the built-in checks implemented by the current CLI. Store-compliance mode can add Store-specific checks; do not assume that every metadata or quality rule is Store-only.

Common flags include:

- `--only <tools>` — run only the named checkers (comma-separated).
- `--exclude <tools>` — remove checkers from the selected set.
- All checkers run by default, including PHPStan, ESLint, and Stylelint. `--full` is deprecated and has no effect. To do a quick validation use `--only builtin` (`sw-cli` remains accepted as a legacy alias and emits a deprecation warning).
- `--check-against <mode>` — `highest` (default) or `lowest`: which supported Shopwell version to check against.
- `--store-compliance` — enable Store-compliance mode while the current CLI supports the flag. Prefer `validation.store_compliance: true` in `.shopwell-extension.yml` for persistent Store intent.
- `--format <format>` — choose an output format supported by the current CLI (`--reporter` is a deprecated alias).
- `--no-copy` — do not copy extension files to a temporary directory.
- `--verbose` — show debug output.

For Store-distribution workflows, use the `shopwell-cli-extension-store` skill when available.

Each command selects only tools that support its operation. For example, `extension validate --only prettier` is an error because Prettier formats but does not check; the error lists available checkers. The extension command summaries show `invoked` or `skipped`: these describe selection and invocation, not whether files were applicable, findings were produced, or fixes were made.

### Fresh results beat saved reports

Saved outputs such as `validation.json`, JUnit XML, or markdown reports can become stale after files are fixed or changed.

Before diagnosing a validation failure, rerun validation against the current working tree. If a saved report contradicts the current files or a fresh run, treat the saved report as stale.

### CI and reporters

In automated environments, prefer machine-readable output when useful:

```bash
shopwell-cli project validate --format json > validation-results.json
shopwell-cli project validate --format junit > validation-results.xml
shopwell-cli extension validate . --format github
shopwell-cli extension validate . --format gitlab
```

Reporters format emitted output. They do not by themselves post comments or annotations to pull requests or merge requests; CI configuration must consume the output appropriately.

Use the process exit code as the validation result. A reporter can change formatting, but validation errors still make the command fail.

### Domain-specific routing

When validation fails in a specific area, route users to relevant skills when available:

- **PHP test failures** → `php-testing` skill.
- **JavaScript/Admin failures** → `admin-testing` skill.
- **Acceptance test failures** → `acceptance-testing` skill.
- **Accessibility findings** → `accessibility-testing` skill.
- **Architecture or LSP findings** → `architecture-review` skill.

### Validation troubleshooting

When `validate` produces unexpected results:

1. **Verify the exact CLI binary and version.**
   - Use `command -v shopwell-cli` and `shopwell-cli --version`.
   - When testing a checkout, use its built binary consistently.

2. **Verify the working directory and project configuration.**
   - Ensure `.shopwell-project.yml` or `.shopwell-extension.yml` is present and correct.
   - Check `--verbose` output when useful.

3. **Regenerate validation output.**
   - Do not diagnose current files from an old saved report.

4. **Check installed and locked tool versions.**
   - Full validation can depend on external tools such as PHPStan, ESLint, and Stylelint.
   - Verify relevant dependencies and configuration.

5. **Understand tool statuses.**
   - `skipped` means a tool was not selected or was excluded; the status note gives the reason.
   - `invoked` means the tool was called, not that it analyzed files or succeeded. Use findings and the exit code for the validation result.

6. **Avoid ad hoc workarounds.**
   - Do not bypass validation with manual lower-level commands before understanding why the CLI behaved as it did.

7. **Check environment and runtime prerequisites.**
   - Some checks may require Docker, PHP, npm dependencies, or other tooling.

## Creating a new project

Use `shopwell-cli project create` to scaffold a new Shopwell project.

```bash
shopwell-cli project create --help
shopwell-cli project create [name] [version] [flags]
```

Always check current `--help` first; treat the flag list below as orientation, not the source of truth.

### Ask the user; do not guess

When this skill drives project creation, you typically run `create` non-interactively (`-n`), so the CLI's own prompts never appear and it silently applies defaults — some of which differ from the interactive ones (Elasticsearch defaults **on** non-interactively but **off** in the prompts). Do not inherit those defaults blind. Confirm the choices with the user first, then pass them as explicit flags. Frame each option by what it does for the user, not by errors it prevents or internal codes — e.g. justify skipping Elasticsearch as "simpler setup, only needed for large catalogs or advanced search", never with a 500 or index error. Walk through:

- **Name** (`[name]`) — the project directory. Ask for it; do not default to the current directory (it must be empty or non-existent).
- **Version** (`--version`) — e.g. `6.6.0.0` or `latest`.
- **Docker** (`--docker`) — **recommended.** Runs the local setup in Docker instead of relying on a local PHP/toolchain.
- **Local domain** (`--local-domain`) — **recommended** (requires `--docker`). Serves the shop at a stable `<name>.shopwell.local` via the shared proxy instead of a port. First time on a machine it needs a one-time `shopwell-cli project proxy setup` (sudo: DNS + HTTPS trust) — non-interactive `create` never runs this, so plan to run it separately.
- **PHP version** (`--php-version`) — `8.2`–`8.5`; usually leave it to the CLI. Ask only if the user needs a specific one; it must satisfy the chosen Shopwell version's PHP constraint.
- **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch** (`--with-elasticsearch`) — recommend leaving it off unless the user needs it (large catalogs or advanced search). It is enabled by default non-interactively, so to disable it pass `--with-elasticsearch=false` (omitting the flag leaves it on under `-n`; the separate `--without-elasticsearch` flag is deprecated).
- **AMQP** (`--with-amqp`) — ask; enable only if they need queue/messaging support.
- **Deployment** (`--deployment`) — `none|container|deployer|platformsh|shopwell-paas` (default `none`).
- **CI/CD** (`--ci`) — `none|github|gitlab` (default `none`).
- **Git** (`--git`) — initialize a repository.
- **Audit** (`--no-audit`) — do not set preemptively; only use it if security advisories block the install and the user accepts the risk.

With `--docker`, `create` runs for several minutes: it pulls the dev image and runs `composer install`, autoload generation, and post-install scripts inside the container. This is expected, not a hang. Surface progress to the user — stream the command's output, or run it in the background and report the current stage from the log — rather than blocking silently.

**`create` scaffolds; it does not install the shop.** It writes the project, runs `composer install`, and creates `.shopwell-project.yml` (plus compose file / git when requested). The database is **not** set up yet. To install afterwards:

- `shopwell-cli project dev install` — non-interactive: starts the environment, runs the install, and saves admin credentials to the project config (defaults `admin` / `shopwell`, `en-GB`, `EUR`; override with `--admin-username`/`--admin-password`/`--locale`/`--currency`). Idempotent — skips when the shop is already installed.
- `shopwell-cli project dev` — the interactive TUI dashboard when you want to drive it by hand.

**Other gotchas**

- **Security advisories** block a non-interactive install unless `--no-audit` is set; interactive mode prompts instead.
- The target folder must be empty; hostname collisions (a `<name>.shopwell.local` already in use) surface at `proxy`/`dev` time, not at create.

## Inspect the project before deciding

Relevant files can include:

- `.config/shopwell-project.yml` / `.shopwell-project.yaml` / `.shopwell-project.yml` (shop URL and Admin API credentials live under `environments`; empty `-e` targets `environments.local`)
- `.config/shopwell-extension.yml` / `.shopwell-extension.yml` / `.shopwell-extension.yaml`
- `composer.json`
- `composer.lock`
- `manifest.xml`

Do not infer the project type, extension type, target environment, or Shopwell version solely from the user's wording.

Only the first found `yml` / `yaml` is used in the specified order above, prefer the first one for new projects.

Prefer CLI-provided configuration schemas over remembered configuration fields.

## Non-interactive and agent execution

For unattended or agent-driven execution, prefer:

```bash
shopwell-cli --no-interaction <command>
```

or:

```bash
shopwell-cli -n <command>
```

If required values are missing, inspect `--help` and provide them explicitly rather than guessing answers to prompts.

Prefer machine-readable output when the command explicitly supports it.

## Credentials and sensitive data

Never expose access tokens, passwords, client secrets, database credentials, or other secret values in responses, logs, examples, or committed files.

Prefer Shopwell CLI's supported authentication and configuration mechanisms instead of manipulating credential storage directly.

Database dumps and other exports may contain sensitive customer or shop data. Treat their creation, storage, and sharing accordingly.

## Generated files

Distinguish source files from generated files before editing them.

When Shopwell CLI owns generation of an artifact, prefer regenerating it through the appropriate CLI command instead of manually editing generated output.

Inspect command help before regenerating anything that may overwrite existing files.

## Troubleshooting

When a Shopwell CLI command fails:

1. Capture the exact command and error.
2. Check the exact binary path and `--version`.
3. Inspect the command's `--help`.
4. Verify the working directory and relevant project or extension configuration.
5. Retry with `--verbose` when useful.
6. Check whether the correct project environment is selected and available.
7. Inspect the underlying Composer, Symfony, Docker, npm, PHP, or API operation only after establishing what Shopwell CLI attempted to do.

Do not work around a failing Shopwell CLI command with lower-level tooling until you understand what CLI behavior or configuration would be bypassed.

## Information priority

When behavior is unclear, use this order:

1. the current CLI binary and fresh runtime output;
2. project configuration and CLI-provided schemas;
3. the current `shopwell-shop/shopwell-cli` source and tests when implementation details are required;
4. official Shopwell CLI documentation.

Prefer version-correct facts over remembered Shopwell behavior or stale generated reports.
